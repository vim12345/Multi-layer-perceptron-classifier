# Multi-layer-perceptron-classifier

# Description:
A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural networks with one or more hidden layers. It can model complex relationships and is widely used for classification tasks. In this project, we implement an MLP classifier using Keras to classify the Iris dataset.

# ðŸ§  What This Project Demonstrates:
* Builds a fully connected neural network for multi-class classification

* Trains and validates an MLP using backpropagation

* Visualizes the accuracy curve to monitor performance
